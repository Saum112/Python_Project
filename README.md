# Twitter Bot
Using Python and the tweepy library makes it easy to create a Twitter bot that takes care of the likes of specified hashtags and usernames for you. 
To create a Twitter bot the tweepy library comes handy. It manages the Twitter API calls and provides a simple interface.
To use the Twitter API the bot needs to authenticate against Twitter. For that, tweepy uses the OAuth authentication standard. You can get credentials by creating a new application at https://apps.twitter.com/.
